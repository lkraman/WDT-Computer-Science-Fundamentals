Short Answer:
1) Why do programmers use pseudocode?
    Pseudocode breaks down a problem's solution into an easy-to-read, series of steps that can easily be converted into actual code.

2) If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
    Pseudocode is not written in a programming language with syntax. It is meant for other programmers to easily understand the algorithm. Computers woud not be able to understand the language.

Programming Assignment:

Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

1) Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
BEGIN
CALL function greaterNumber with numOne and numTwo
IF numOne greater than numTwo
    PRINT numOne
ELSE
    PRINT numTwo
END

2) Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.
BEGIN
INIT variable num to 1
WHILE
  num is less than 100
  increment by 1
  UNTIL num is 100
  LOG sequence to console
END WHILE

3) Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.
BEGIN
SET variable names to phonebook database
SET variable foundNames to names.filter to function to foundName
RETURN foundName with triple equals comparison operator and "<your last name
LOG foundNames to the console
END

4) Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

let names = ["jones", "bales", "brown", "jones", "davis"];

const foundNames = names.filter(function(foundName) {
  return foundName === "jones";
});

console.log(foundNames);
